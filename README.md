# MyDocuments
Just like the name implies.

So far I have:
## Install\_Arduino\_Libraries.md
* format: Markdown
* description: This document provides instructions for installing _-library_ repositories in my GitHub into a user's Arduino IDE files.
  
## Install\_Arduino\_Sketches.md
* format: Markdown
* description: This document provides instructions for installing _-sketches_ repositories in my GitHub into a user's Arduino IDE files.
  
## arduinos_multitask.pdf
* format: PDF
* description: This is a PDF copy of the OpenOffice Impress presentation that was shown at the Dec 10 2016 meeting of the Montgomery Village Arduino Meetup.  It describes using "state machines" in code to give Arduinos, which usually are coded to perform a single task, the ability to easily interleave multiple tasks, each with its own scheduling.
